# Scripts
Collection of scripts

Welcome to my little space of dumb scripts
We know you have choices when it comes to dumb scripting repos but we are glad you chose my repo of dumb scripts

[DISCLAIMER]
Please run these scripts on machines you have expressed permission to deploy at your own risk. Don't be a skiddie.
Additionally, none of these scripts should break anything, but  fair warning either way.
Some scripts are OS specific (primarily .ps1 files) and some require admin/sudo privileges.

[Contents]

->.ps1 - Collection of Powershell scripts
  -Personal favorite: weather.ps1 (quick weather app that uses Microsoft TTS)

->.py - Collection of Python scripts
  -Personal favorite: pacs.py (packet sniffer)

More to come as I make more dumb things
